    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Merrill Datwyler—an engineer, systems thinker, and curious builder. My work blends signal processing, computational photography, and neurological modeling with a deep interest in design and digital tools that improve clarity.</p>

    <p>I studied electrical and computer engineering, with an academic focus on modeling, pattern recognition, and tools that serve both creativity and rigor. I care about interfaces that empower, processes that scale well, and code that’s built to last.</p>
